# ChessNeuralNetCode

Requires a .txt file named "CheckGamesOnline.txt" containing algebraic chess notation in order to train the network in the ConvolutionalGary.py file. This file was impractically large to upload.

After a network is created, trained and saved by the ConvolutionalGary.py program, the network can be loaded and played by the PlayingCNNGary.py file.
